  -In Taiwan, some people regarded elders, women and old women as traffic disturbance. In order to found out the fact about traffic disturbance, we used the open data of 2016 Taipei traffic accidents. We considered the variables of genders, ages, and injuries in our model and discussed which variables would cause traffic accidents through Bayesian statistics.
